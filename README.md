# kyberphysics

**kyber** - governance, control, or steering

**physics** - the study of information and dynamics

When we talk about human ability, we often use theory and experimental results from *psychophysics*, the formalization of perception and sensation in the language of physics. 

Here, we are interested in the inverse: developing an understanding of action, control, and learning in the language of physics. We call this *kyberphysics*. 

## usage

install the package locally with `python3 -m pip install -e .` inside the top-level directory

running submodules using `python3 -m <path.to.module>` taking care not to include the `.py` suffix

## notebooks

should work just fine if you run from the top-level directory
