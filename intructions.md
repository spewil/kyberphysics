intructions
movements

the name of each movement will come up on the screen
wait until the green cue appears to initiate the movement, then make the movement and hold until the green cue goes away
the green cue will appear three times per movement, each time for one second
the movements are in order [list and demonstrate each movement]
NB: subjects confuse wrist in and out with wrist up and down-- make this clear. "In" is towards you and "out" is away from you.
we will do this task twice

calibration

this is an "exploration" and "isolation" task
you will see 63 vertical white bars and 1 red bar on the screen
object of the task is to explore your movements to activate the red bar (increase its height) without activating the white bars (increase their heights) by isolating the red bar from the white bars
it's important that you try your best every trial so we get a picture of your capability
you are not necessarily "good" or "bad" at the task, just try your best
it is more important here to isolate than to activate (less total activity is better)
any movement can be used to complete the task
we will repeat this task two times in total

center hold

white circle will appear
rest until your blue cursor is hidden by the white dot
once youre at rest, the white circle will disappear and a red target will appear
you have a short amount of time to move to the target, 
this completes one trial
we will complete three sessions with short breaks in between
