data organization
- how to ignore no-holds...?
- query the data without holding it in memory? (API for the data, effectively)
- 

analysis ideas

first movement as a plan/feedforward?
hits per target (polar plot)
movements in total (polar plot)
score calibration task?
SNR of baseline signal? correlates with success?
classifier training on natural movement data?
	to then classify initial movements? 
hierarchy?
	dimensionality over time?
feedback
	after initial movement
	what is a correction?
time of day of recording correlates?

movements and their opposites (agonist/antagonist pairs) are a strong prior!

are similar movements made after they are rewarded?

are some decoders more aligned to the targets?

by friday
- behavior statistics
	- hits
	- misses
	- time to hit
	- length of trajectory?
- trajectory statistics

some directions are more difficult -- can still measure ability even without the hit (e.g. andrei whose force level kept him from moving left easily...:(

andrei -- level of required force? need to control for this as well

plot arm size vs X
plot overall force / variance vs X
action distribution statistics vs X

coffee drinkers and non
hours from lunch
sleep hours

bottleneck
- between trajectory (or some feature thereof) and target?
  - how well can we predict target from trajectory? or vice versa?
  - this means how well can subjects infer motor activations given target (the policy)
  
# experiment 2 

- is exploration strategy different from interleaved?
- is learning faster?
- do we have enough participants to compare these two groups?
	- variance within each group higher than variance between?
